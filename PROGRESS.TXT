OK, I HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE MAIL FOR REGISTER CONFIRMATION BY THE USER.
A LOT OF THINGS CAN FAIL THOUGH, SO ITS AWAITING TESTING.
IN A FUTURE VERSION WE WILL PUT A RICH TEXT EDITOR.
NOW WE ARE MISSING THE FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE GUEST USER NAMES AND ALSO
WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THE FUNCTIONALITY TO ERASE ALL MESSAGES OF THE DATABASE
AND ALSO ADD AN ADMIN WHO IS THE ONLY THAT CAN DO SUCH THING.
ALSO WE COULD ADD THE CONTROL TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE ADMIN.
